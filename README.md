Ginkgo Benchmark Explorer
-------------------------

Ginkgo benchmark explorer is a web application facilitating interactive
analysis of performance data obtained from the
[Ginkgo library](https://github.com/ginkgo-project/ginkgo). To see the
application in action go to its
[github page](https://ginkgo-project.github.io/ginkgo-benchmark-explorer). The
benchmark data precessed by the application is regularly updated to reflect the
latest version of the library via the CI system. This data can also be
downloaded [here](https://github.com/ginkgo-project/ginkgo-data).


Ginkgo benchmark explorer is built using [Angular](https://angular.io) and uses
[Angular Material Components](https://material.angular.io) to assemble its
interface.  The editing / data viewing capabilities are powered by the [Monaco
editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor), and the plots generated
using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org). Scripting is enabled via
[JSONata](http://jsonata.org).
